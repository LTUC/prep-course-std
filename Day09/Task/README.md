# HR-management-system

## Task 9

### Overview

You will continue building on what you achieved in the last two tasks.

### Requirements

You will use the local storage to save the employees information to use in the accounting.html page.

#### **Set up your Github Repository***

- Today you will continue working on your `HR-management-system` repo.
- Update your **README** file to add your changes for today.
- Checkout a new branch called `localStorage` for today's task.
- Open it in VS code.

#### Home Page

Save all the employees in the Local Storage so when I refresh the page I will not lose my old data.

#### Accounting Page

Create a new js file called accounting.js to use it in this page.

1. Render each department information in a table:
    - Department Name
    - Number of employees in each department.
    - Average salary of the department
    - Total salary
        Where average salary is the summation of salaries for all employees in each department divided by the number of the employees in that department and total salary is the summation of salaries for all employees in each department.

2. Add a table footer which will have the total number of employees, the average salary for all departments and the total salary for all departments, as shown below.

|Department|\# of employees|Total Salary|Average|
|---|---|---|---|--|
|Administration|
|Marketing|
|Development|
|Finance|
|Total|Total number of employees|Total salary for all departments|Average salary for all departments|
