- Tour component:

    - In the tour component you have to display the same data that you have displayed before which are [ image, name ].

- Routing:
   - your will have two routes as the following: 
      1. To navigate back to the home page, path="/"
      2. in order to show more details about the city, path=`”/city/:id”`
  - Update your `<Header/>` to be containing a link that navigates to home.
  
         

- Tour Details:
    - Once the user clicks on any of the cities cards that you created, it should show details about that city.
